# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The What's For Dinner app will help users decide what to make for dinner. The app will create a randomized 7-day meal plan with recipies and a shopping list. Most days, 5 o'clock rolls around and I have no idea what to make my family for dinner. If I could just get some ideas! My hope is that by having 7 days worth of meals planned out, less dread will go into the grind of 'what's for dinner.'
### Features
Features will include:
- manually add recipies
- randomly select recipies from the list
- select preferences/dietary criteria
- generate a shopping list from the selected recipies
- create a favorites list
- rating/reviewing completed recipe

other/future features:
- pull recipies in from an API
- create favorites lists for different family members

### Technologies
We will use JavaScript and Angular, CSS with Bootstrap, maybe JAVA and MySQL for database management and GitHub pages to deploy.
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn Bootstrap and GitHub pages for the first time. I will also need to learn how to link an API if we decide to do that.
